The Code

This is a virtual ATM.
In it basic atm functions can occur.
You should be able to withdraw amounts and know if the withdrawal is successful or not. It can assign accounts to several individuals and assign them a pin number for security. After a transaction, a reciept is shown with an error message on what went wrong and success readouts for successful transactions such as the amount and types of bills used.


Dependencies
